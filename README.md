# Publish JMeter Plugin Action

This GitHub Action automates the process of publishing a plugin to the
[JMeter Plugins Manager repository](https://github.com/undera/jmeter-plugins).

It generates the required metadata from the latest GitHub release of your plugin and creates a pull
request to the target repository.

## Features

- Automatically fetches the latest GitHub release of your plugin.
- Generates a release object and updates the appropriate JSON file inside the repository.
- Updates the target repository with the new release details.
- Handles forking, branching, and creating a pull request to the upstream repository.

## Inputs

The action requires the following inputs:

## Outputs

The action throws a single output:

| Output         | Description                                                      |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `pull_request` | URL of the generated Pull Request into the `upstream-repository` |

## Usage

Hereâ€™s how to set up and use this action in your workflow:

```yaml
name: Publish to JMeter Plugins

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      changes:
        description: 'Release notes for the update'
        required: true

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run Publish JMeter Plugin Action
        id: publish-plugin
        uses: abstracta/jmeter-plugin-publish-action@main
        with:
          forked-repository: https://github.com/Abstracta/jmeter-plugins.git
          plugin-artifact-name: prefix-of-example-plugin-name
          plugin-id: example-plugin-id
          changes: ${{ inputs.changes }}
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          artifact-version-extraction-patterns: |
            example-lib-(.*)

      - name: Print Pull Request URL
        run: echo ${{ steps.publish-plugin.outputs.pull_request }}
```

>

## How It Works

1. **Input Validation**: The action ensures all required inputs are provided.
1. **Repository Setup**: It checks out the forked repository and configures upstream and origin
   remotes.
1. **Metadata Generation**: Extracts version and library details from the latest GitHub release of
   the plugin.
1. **Update**: Locates the correct section using plugin-id and appends the new release details.
1. **Branching and PR**: Creates a new release branch, commits the changes, and pushes the branch to
   the forked repository. A pull request is then created to the upstream repository using the
   `token`.

## Notes

- Ensure your plugin JAR and all required dependencies are correctly published in the GitHub release
  of your repository.
- Pull request is created in a draft mode working as a stagging area for manually validation
- Use a
  [GitHub PAT token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic)
  with sufficient permissions for repository and PR actions.
- Customize ignore-dependencies if some libraries should not be included in the release metadata.
- Field `"depends"` of the release JSON object is grabbed from the latest release.
    - Desire of updates requires a manual modification over the PR

### In depth

#### artifact-version-extraction-patterns

The action uses by default a lazy approach when it comes to generate the lib version and artifact
name to be impacted in the JMeter Plugins repository definition.

In case your plugin has a library labeled with a nomenclature `library-0.3-jdk-8.jar` by default the
plugin will consider as artifact name `library-0.3-jdk` and version `8` which isn't entirely correct
for all scenarios.

> In above example the artifact name is `library` and the version is `0.3-jdk-8`.

The property configuration for above scenario will be:

```yaml
      - name: Run Publish JMeter Plugin Action
        id: publish-plugin
        uses: abstracta/jmeter-plugin-publish-action@main
        with:
          . # other
          . # properties
          . # here
          artifact-version-extraction-patterns: |
            library-(.*)
```

In that way the resultant release will be:

 ```json
 {
  "1.0.1": {
    "changes": "A new release",
    "downloadUrl": "https://example.com/your-plugin.jar",
    "libs": {
      "library>=0.3-jdk-8": "https://example.com/library-0.3-jdk-8.jar"
    }
  }
}
```

> Instead of `"library-0.3-jdk>=8"`
